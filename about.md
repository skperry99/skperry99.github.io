<div class="project-card">
  <p>
    Hi, I’m <strong>Sarah Perry</strong> — a <strong>full-stack software developer</strong>
    who enjoys building applications that are both technically solid and genuinely fun to use.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started my career designing and optimizing <strong>wireless networks</strong> — large,
    complex systems that demanded precision and creative problem-solving. After 15 years
    in engineering, I shifted into <strong>software development</strong>, where I get to apply
    the same analytical mindset to interactive, user-facing experiences.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through <strong>LaunchCode’s Full-Stack Software Developer</strong> program, I’ve built
    projects with <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>,
    <strong>Spring Boot</strong>, and <strong>MySQL</strong>. I love how coding blends logic,
    creativity, and collaboration, and I’m excited to keep growing as a developer and contributing
    to meaningful, approachable tools.
  </p>
