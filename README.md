### 💼 About Me

I'm a full-stack software developer who loves creating applications that are both technically solid and delightful to use.

I began my career designing and optimizing wireless networks — large, intricate systems that required precision and creative problem-solving.
After 15 years in engineering, I discovered a new passion in software development, where I get to combine the same analytical mindset with creative design and user interaction.

Through LaunchCode’s Full-Stack Software Developer program, I’ve built hands-on projects using JavaScript, React, Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL.

I love how coding brings together logic, creativity, and collaboration — and I’m excited to keep growing as a developer, contributing to meaningful projects that make technology approachable and inspiring.
