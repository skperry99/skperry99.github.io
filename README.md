### 💼 About Me

I'm a full-stack software developer who enjoys building applications that are both technically solid and genuinely fun to use.

I started my career designing and optimizing wireless networks — large, complex systems that demanded precision and creative problem-solving. After 15 years in engineering, I shifted into software development, where I get to apply the same analytical mindset to interactive, user-facing experiences.

Through LaunchCode’s Full-Stack Software Developer program, I’ve built projects with JavaScript, React, Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL. I love how coding blends logic, creativity, and collaboration, and I’m excited to keep growing as a developer and contributing to meaningful, approachable tools.
