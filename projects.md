    Furever Friends Rescue is a cheerful, story-driven React web app that simulates a pet adoption experience at a fictional animal rescue.

    <ul>
      <li>Built a multi-page React app with React Router for smooth, dynamic navigation between pages.</li>
      <li>Implemented a smart adoption interest form that auto-fills the selected animal’s name from the gallery.</li>
      <li>Designed reusable components for pet profiles, stories, and forms to keep the UI consistent and maintainable.</li>
      <li>Created a fully responsive layout with custom CSS, Google Fonts, and subtle animations for a friendly, accessible experience.</li>
      <li>Added fun “delight moments,” including confetti celebrations on successful adoption interest submissions.</li>
    </ul>
